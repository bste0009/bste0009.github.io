        When Apple released the iPhone X in November last year, it created a totemic metaphor for the nature of our time. By removing the home button and the frame that once surrounded the screen, the phone’s surface became unbounded and limitless. The message was clear: there is no longer a boundary between your screen and the world around it.

        As we look around the modern world, we see the ghosts of other conventional distinctions, which now appear as arbitrary as the borders on our phones. On the internet, the gap between next door and next continent implodes. Northern Baroque paintings, Triassic fossils and yesterday’s op-eds are tabs on the same browser. Raised by a global chorus of voices, our identities are voluntary, malleable and unprescribed. We are everywhere, anytime and everyone at once.
        <br>
        <br>
        Along with architect Jack Self and graphic designer Jonathan Castro, 032c devoted the cover story of its summer issue to mapping a new cultural moment we call The Big Flat Now. This terrain is already a platform for new forms of creativity, upvoted into existence by the same mass who invented them. In this ecosystem, gesture, friendship and amateurism have replaced jargon, messaging and expertise. Product design has become a form of DJing — and DJing has become a form of product design. Contemporary art and luxury fashion have come to operate according to the same logic, sharing practitioners who glide freely between each field. Film, music, fashion, visual art and the marketing machines that support them have been compressed into a unified slime called “content.”
        <br>
        <br>
        The Big Flat Now changes the languages we must use to describe the things, places and people that move through the creative industry. The name of this concept was born during a visit to the studio of Sterling Ruby, in which it became clear that the past mode of culture did not have the vocabulary to describe a practitioner who exhibits art, creates store architecture for Calvin Klein, takes apart battleships and designs clothes — among many other things.
        <br>

        This season, Louis Vuitton presented its first menswear collection by Virgil Abloh, proving that its decision to hire a designer-slash-DJ-slash-artist who trained as an architect could not be more apt. Likewise, it would be naive to call the Fondazione Prada a “museum,” but it would equally cynical to call it “marketing.” The answer now lies somewhere in between.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some voices, especially those who prognosticate about the internet being the end of culture, have confused The Big Flat Now with postmodern irony. They describe this new order’s cultural products as collages that simply push around pre-existing references. However, there is nothing inherently inauthentic or cynical about this activity.
        <br>
        <br>
        The early days of the mainstream internet were dominated by mashups and remixes, but creative license in the era of The Big Flat Now is about being both at once. The spirit of the mash-up was driven by the novelty of seeing two unexpected things appear side by side, as well as the pseudo-countercultural act of intervening in pop culture. The humor of this gesture falls flat for Generation Z, whose unparalleled degree of visibility and cultural access makes irony feel cheap. Where remixing is part of a dialogue about the zeitgeist, the condition of being both is strictly about the future. It describes a reality in which we can all own new space, rather than competing to replicate the status quo.
        <br>
        <br>
        While past modes of communication relied on explanations, definitions and arguments, creative practitioners today operate predominantly through mood and ambiance. Through the logic of “being both,” The Big Flat Now will present us with concepts that push toward the edges of our existing systems of meaning. When a mumble rapper chants an inaudible hook, or a stylist refers to an “early grunge color story,” they are each practicing their craft on the edge of language. Tech mogul Elon Musk and indie star Grimes’ unironic romantic relationship; Playboi Carti’s use of sounds as opposed to words to make a lyrical patchwork in his songs; and the baby dragons clutched in the arms of models on the Gucci Autumn/Winter 2018 runway — are all phenomena that can be decoded through the lens of this new paradigm.

        When Balenciaga made its own version of a Croc sandal, priced it at $850, and advertised it in a campaign inspired by the 2000s campaigns of mid-market footwear brand Steve Madden, many asked whether this was irony, industry critique or a kaleidoscopic outpouring of nostalgia. The answer is none of the above. Like a meme — which works by smashing together image and text — the Balenciaga Croc is a tongue-in-cheek critique, critical nostalgia and nostalgic irony all at once. A single word for what it is does not quite exist yet.
        <br>
        <br>
        A decade of curatorship has led to a widespread fetish for provenance. In a world that propels itself forward through the remobilization of references, delineating the roots of new forms has become a source of pride, or even grounds for vigilante policing. But squabbling about the origin of things is a farce in our technological, globalized present. Like carrots pushing themselves out of the ground, successful ideas now make themselves available and functional in all contexts. The conversation surrounding appropriation in the fashion industry has become one in which critics are accusing creators of the very practices that they proudly confess to be doing.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Yes, this patch is a New Order album cover.” “Yes, this suit was tailored after something from a 1970s B-Movie.” “Yes, this has existed before, but so has everything else.” Appropriation, in this context, is not an inherently violent and larcenous act, but rather the primary technique through which ideas are organized and reformulated. While it is undeniable that the West has enriched itself through the economic and creative colonization of marginalized peoples, it would be a mistake to confuse power with its tools. Trying to end cultural exploitation by policing “appropriation” is like trying to fight bank robbery by making ski-masks illegal.

        In 1866, the biologist Ernst Haeckel proposed the idea that all life on Earth emerged from a primordial sea of Urschleim, a formless protoplasm with the capacity to be shaped into anything. With access to the necessary tools, today an idea is as likely to manifest as a t-shirt as it is a painting, magazine or film. These concepts are as much shaped by how they fit on the feed as they are by the original ideas behind them.
        <br>
        <br>
        The amorphous thing called content has a porous membrane, with infinite points for soft, fluid monetization. On the terrain of The Big Flat Now, commerce is no longer antithetical to culture. In fact, it can more readily become absorbed into the medium itself. Whereas television programs and magazines have designated spaces for advertisements, the feed where content lives is a much more ambiguous terrain. Considered holistically, the slur “advertorial” can be applied to almost every statement or gesture.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a space where so much seems familiar, new ideas have more value than ever before. While The Big Flat Now uses the frictionless collision of the pre-existing to create new cultural formulations, its energy is invariably directed toward the future. It is easy to believe that in a context so saturated with symbols and history, it would be impossible to create anything new, but the impulse still exists and we must continue to cultivate it.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is possible that we are more creatively free today than we have ever been. The entirety of human culture has become raw material that has been open-sourced for the purposes of production. What was once banal is now fascinating and vice-versa. We marvel at the makeup how-to or the ASMR video on YouTube, share it with friends, make our own, put them online and compete. There is no longer a divide between inspiration and expression, between consumption and production. It is easy to get lost the economy of The Big Flat Now and this phase of infinite growth is only getting started.

              <br>
              <div id="heading">Curated by MAURIZIO CATTELAN at the behest of Gucci creative director ALESSANDRO MICHELE, “The Artist is Present,” currently on view at the Yuz Museum in Shanghai, takes its name from Marina Abramović’s famous endurance performance at MoMA back in 2012. Cryptic promotions for the show that appeared on Gucci “art walls” in Hong Kong, New York, London, and Milan this summer featured the face of an Abramović lookalike, staring down the viewer, revealing little about the exhibition other than that its central theme would be appropriation.
              </div>
              <br>
              <div id="subheading">The intervention in Shanghai is far from a direct copy, however, and Cattelan doesn’t sit face-to-face with museum visitors at the Yuz. Instead, he assembled works from more than 30 artists that, like Cattelan’s own oeuvre, question notions of reproduction and authenticity – themes also addressed in The New Work Times, a satirical “newspaper” distributed to museum visitors from a New York Times dispenser, replete with (fake) stories about clones and counterfeits. The exhibition’s sponsorship from a major fashion house, and its staging in China, seems perplexing at first, but there is a distinct logic to the collaboration and its execution. Michele, too, has confronted themes of copying, reinterpretation and originality during his tenure at Gucci – inaugurated in 2015 after CEO Marco Bizzarri visited the former handbag-designer’s personal museum of curiosities – bringing bootleg culture onto its runways and into its collections.

          What are the questions that you’re seeking to answer with “The Artist Is Present”? Why are they relevant now?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewanswer">
        You know that saying, “Good books make you ask questions. Bad readers want everything answered”? I really want the show to be a series of deep questions, more than I want to be one of those curators who has the presumption to provide his own personal straight answer. It could sound like a bit of an understatement, but that was our starting point. The relationship between copy and originality has always been relevant. Today, it is relevant to question the existence of originality, because it is deeply linked with the power of individualism, and we can all feel that that power is becoming more and more weak.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewquestion">
        How were the concerns of “The Artist is Present” – originality, truth, identity – inspired by China itself: by Dafen Village, by replica cities such as Shanghai’s Holland Town and Thames Town, and of course by the country’s fashion and tech bootlegging infrastructure?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewanswer">
        Definitely, the context was very inspiring, and I’m sure anyone looking at the exhibition and browsing the articles featured in The New Work Times can see that. There’s one work by Winnie Won Yin Wong on the cover of the newspaper that particularly fits the theme of what you’ll find in the show, and talks about Dafen and its relationship with contemporary art. I visited Dafen once, and since then I was tormented by a vision that this show made possible to realize: a replica of the Sistine Chapel on a 1:6 scale. For the first time that masterpiece is made accessible on a human scale and allows everyone to see it close up and without any limitations. If humanity’s maximum aspiration is to become God, the maximum aspiration of the copy is to become the original. The truth is that, between these walls, we can all become closer to God.

        Do Chinese philosophy and Buddhism offer deeper, more ancient antecedents for contemporary borrowing culture – perhaps its lighter, funnier side?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewanswer">
        I believe irony is a fundamental ingredient of every aspect of human life, and it is also what distinguishes us from other animals. When dealing with a culture of appropriation, it is of course that twist that makes you turn a potentially litigious situation into something that enriches both works – the original, and the copy. Chinese philosophy is many enriching things, and I’m not so much in the Buddhist thought to say whether or not it’s also ironic or self-aware, but I would not be surprised to discover it is. To take yourself less seriously could definitely be a good additional commandment.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewquestion">
        At what stage of your career did you come to fancy Marina Abramović?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewanswer">
        I have always really loved her titles!
       </div>
       <br>
       <div id="interviewquestion">
        How does your work on authenticity and appropriation fit with the Gucci brand in 2018? Creative Director Alessandro Michele is often talked about as the singular driving force behind its recent success, and Gucci’s productions are not only widely copied, but also reference bootlegs in their presentations and work.
       </div>
       <br>
       <div id="interviewanswer">
        I’ve always thought that the moment that you start working alone is the moment you start failing. Alessandro is a great creative director because he knows how to get the best from his collaborators – and he chooses them carefully because he knows they are as important as he is. He recognized in me a good partner in crime: we had both previously worked on the concept of appropriation, copyleft, and, in a way, cloning too. It was like we were destined to cross paths sooner or later. Of course, it’s true that we’re speaking different languages, but we are both fascinated witnesses of the overcoming of originality in our contemporary society.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewquestion">
        In your series, “What I’ve Learned About Copies,” published at Artnet, you noted three important “rules”: 1. Truth is a matter of faith. 2. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. 3. To create something out of nothing is a god-like quality. How would the contemporary art world change if it took these rules at face value?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="interviewanswer">
        In the last few years, it’s undeniable that we have been experiencing the rise of a stronger concept than “copying,” and that is sharing. It is effecting art, of course, and it will more and more in the future. The interesting part is that in the act of sharing, there’s the absolution of the act of copying.

    <!-- RAVE: Before Streetwear There Was Clubwear-->

        The boy is 16 years old – maybe only 14 – standing in front of a colorful blue, paint-smeared wall. He is wearing baggy camo pants, wine-red combat boots, a t-shirt, keys slung around his neck, and an old dark blue Adidas tracksuit top, his cap tilted on his head.

        <br>
        Wolfgang Tillmans photographed Christos in 1992. The image was most likely published in i-D, sometime in the 1990s. During the early years of his career, the artist documented the nightlife he encountered in Hamburg, London, and across Europe. i-D was, maybe even more than its rival The Face, a central organ for the fashions that emerged not from the catwalks, but from the clubs and the streets in front of them.
        <br>
        <br>
<div id="bodytexttwo">
I worked at a club in the early 1990s: the gay disco Front on Heidenkampsweg in Hamburg. It was a small, fairly radical operation. The doorman was a taciturn mustachioed Tom of Finland type. There was a stash of baseball bats behind the cash register in case of hate attacks. DJs smoked joints in the booth (though these were strictly prohibited), and by 1.30am condensation dripped from the ceiling. All kinds of sex were had in the toilets, though the hardest sex was reserved for the private basement quarters. Drug dealers got free drinks all night – something I hadn’t caught onto at the time. What I did understand was the magic of nightlife: a world of excess, dissolution and maybe even self-destruction – which was exactly why essential art movements, friendships, and fashion styles were born out of it.
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/images/yellowhair.jpeg" alt="painted boy">
<br>
<br>
It might sound romantic and incredibly far away, but back then I cut out the picture of “Christos”and pasted it on my kitchen wall. His lost and defiant gaze seemed to describe exactly how nightlife can claim and seduce a person. His look was programmatic. It probably didn’t cost more than a few drachmas, but still it connected some of the most important style elements of 90s clubwear: uniforms, sportswear, and skate culture. This is what the boys wore at parties and raves, a way of dressing that was the equivalent of mixing music: appropriation, de- and recontextualisation, creation through combination – a cultural technique that has outlasted rave culture itself. It was the way rave- and clubwear was conceived, consumed, and communicated that made it the last youth culture to develop without global brands steering its direction and cashing in. Ironically, or perhaps inevitably, today Christos is part of a private collection – that of Christian and Karen Boros, who show their art in a bunker that was once home to Berlin’s most hardcore parties between 1992 and 1996.
<br>
<br>
It isn’t surprising that clubwear is an important reference for fashion designers today. Some day, 2018 may become known as the year in which the triumphant march of streetwear came to a close. It is notable that nobody wants to use the term anymore, as its figureheads ascend the ranks of high fashion, and creative directors go back to their archives in search of fresh juice. Woolrich recently began a collaboration with the British designer Jeff Griffin, whose signatures are camouflage and club references. After some economic fall-off, Prada is now reacquainting itself with perhaps the most important phase of its history: sporty elegance, directly derived from vulgar futurism and techno culture. As for new blood, photographer Benjamin Alexander Huseby and fashion designer Serhat Ișik are advancing a similar aesthetic with their brand GmbH, with the added suggestion of sex: carefully placed zippers, form-fitting cuts, and clothing made from PVC or fine-rib cotton. Finally, with sneakers – a rave essential – the luxury industry has found a product that is to the men’s market what handbags are to womenswear: an endlessly variable gateway drug with a heavenly margin that doesn’t present the ideological or psychological issues seen elsewhere in fashion. Whether a man needs a tailored suit, an elegant bag, or an expensive watch is a matter of taste. But a sneaker is as self-evidently masculine as a car used to be.

“In the beginning you saw vacuum cleaner backpacks and breathing masks in the clubs,” Alexander Branczyk says over tea in a snug courtyard in Berlin’s Mitte district. Branczyk lives here now and runs the agency Xplicit, but from 1992 to 1997 he was art director of the techno magazine Frontpage. Having originally come to Berlin as a graphic designer to work with Meta-Design, known for its co-founder Erik Spiekermann’s obsessive preoccupation with typography, Branczyk created the font and logo of the Love Parade, thus influencing the entire visual appearance of German club culture. Nightlife in the years following German Reunification fascinated the young designer – the famous Leerstellen [empty spaces] in Berlin where one could simply start a club in a desolate industrial building, with its very own sound. It seemed as though, for the first time, genuine German pop music was being created. Though techno had its roots in Detroit (and in Belgium, and with Kraftwerk), it found its blunt, hymn-like qualities in Berlin and partly in Frankfurt. “Techno translated the character of the Germans – the angry, belligerent combat animal – into pop culture,” says Ulf Poschardt, editor in chief of Die Welt, who published an obsessively substantiated analysis of electronic dance music, DJ Culture, in 1995.
<br>
<br>
Through friends in the nightlife scene, Branczyk met Jürgen Lahrmann, a bulldozer of charisma who founded a kind of techno party-program zine called Frontpage in Frankfurt, then came to Berlin to make something bigger out of it. “We are both originally from Oberursel [in Hesse]. Terrorists and nazis are from there usually. His mother was a math teacher at my school,” Branczyk says of the unusual partnership. In the years that followed, Branczyk handled his agency work during the day and took control of the most influential lifestyle magazine of the 90s at night. He worked on Frontpage under the pen name “czyk,” an illustration of the romanticism of rave culture, with its cold futurism and demonstrative modesty, the dream being to melt together with the machine in a mechanical dance. “An overcrowded Mackintosh desktop with thousands of open windows,” is how Branczyk describes the visual direction of the magazine. He only used fonts he had developed himself, layered articles on top of each other, let typography bleed into text, blurred and pixelated the photos on purpose, and made the record reviews and party reports ridiculously small. “Our principle was: we do not shorten texts. We make the font as small as it has to be for the text to fit,” Branczyk explains. Like many aesthetic movements, the techno look was a revolt against the establishment. In this case, it was a reaction to the immaculate style of British art director Neville Brody, who was responsible for The Face. Even today, the ruthless nature of the design is thrilling – Ray Gun was the only American magazine to take a similar path. “Nobody liked it except for the readers,” Branczyk says. “Frontpage has been left standing uncommented upon in the landscape, but it was a monumental work.”
<br>
<br>
<img src="assets/images/manlooking.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<br>
In terms of fashion, styles crashed into each other in techno clubs. Branczyk describes people wearing parts of vaccum cleaners for looks that were the Burning Man costumes of the early rave years. Buckle on something discarded somewhere in the streets and you were ready for the night. This led to the popularity of garbage collector vests, which became a hated Love Parade cliché. “The fur stuff, the dyed hair, awful,” recalls Poschardt, who once drove a Porsche from Munich to Berlin in total look Stüssy for a magazine feature on Love Parade style. “Road sweepers and whistles. I always thought of ADAC [General German Automobile Club] members. Techno ends bluntly.” Of course, today the signal color look is found only slightly altered in the reflective jackets that Raf Simons designed for Calvin Klein, or in the neon-colored hardware store gloves by Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton (as well as the junk plastic chains that adorn a suite of his bags).

        <div id="subheading">Nearly 15 years ago, on September 30, 2005, Moschino designer Rossella Jardini sent a model down the runway wearing a crown made of pasta—a band of farfalle and great spikes of spaghetti tied with fettuccine bows. She was wearing a black dress printed with pasta, basil, and tiny cherry tomatoes; the look was followed by a cardigan embellished with plastic penne pieces, a skirt with looping skeins of faux spaghetti, a tank top emblazoned with the slogan “TRULY ITALIAN!” and a mess of plastic tomatoes and ribbon cascading over the shoulder, like a waiter had tripped and tossed a platter onto a patron. The collection moved on from the pasta theme to leopard print, gingham, transparent raincoat fabrics, a dress made from ribbon flower cockades, but the first handful of pieces defined it. To borrow a phrase from a 2005 Film.it write-up, it was an “ode to pasta” (“inno alla pasta”).

        I first came across the pasta clothes a couple years ago, while trawling Etsy for vintage Moschino Cheap & Chic. Since then, I’ve only seen a few pieces become available at the same time before they disappear: a spaghetti miniskirt here, a pair of pumps with little tomatoes on the toes there. The pieces are often accompanied by incredulous descriptions or tongue-in-cheek condition notes: One eBay seller caveats that a blazer features a “minor chip on top farfalle…and slight fraying at bottom of spaghetti,” and catalogues “tagliatelle con spinach, penne, farfalle, tortiglioni and basil leaves” sprawling across its lapels.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes are magnificent, wholly committed to the bit. They possess the specific blend of naïveté and worldliness that defines camp; it makes me want to host a dinner party in head-to-toe pasta gear. According to Jennie Walker, a vintage seller with an encyclopedic stock of vintage Moschino, the pasta items may have been inspired by an earlier piece from the 1990s: a linen vest with bowtie pasta buttons, a splat of spaghetti and sauce, and the phrase “SORRY, I’M ITALIAN!” embroidered across the back. The garment was part of Franco Moschino’s “Nature Friendly Garment” line, his final collection before his death in 1994.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walker has the vest, still with its original Neiman Marcus tags, and counts the buttons as we talk on the phone (six, plus one spare bowtie sewn onto the label). The line of inspiration is clear: the same plastic pieces, Italian-flag colors, slogans set in the same serif block text. “This was Franco Moschino really thinking about environmentalism,” she says. The vest is made of natural fibers, except for the fake pasta buttons.

          I have a distinct memory from childhood that a friend owned a dollhouse fridge that could spit plastic cubes of fake ice from a tiny ice dispenser. This delighted us, and although there were only a few ice cubes available and they were incredibly easy to lose—not larger than an earring back—I would search them out, repeating the trick of the cubes tumbling out of the fridge door’s dispenser over and over. Children are discerning judges of the complexity of plastic toys, and the attention to detail thrilled me. I could recognize, on some level, that the item was more complicated than it had to be to be saleable. The fact that the little ice machine actually worked was excess: just for fun.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moschino pastawear inspires a similar feeling. More than necessary to get the point across, with its profusion of three-dimensional life-sized facsimiles, the supplies for a kindergarten macaroni art exercise strewn out across a Milan runway. Perhaps what I’m describing is successful kitsch, something theorist Sianne Ngai describes in her book Theory of the Gimmick as “signifying dilatory pleasures, a utopia of luxurious purposelessness or affordable waste.” It reminds me of a wonderful, vaguely embarrassing line from Henry James’ diary in which he asserts that “l’oeuvre, before God, is what I’m going in for,'' describing his work as a novelist. But such grandiosity is also applicable to any aesthetic product the creator loves beyond reason. This is a version of the feeling all fashion is chasing—something marvelous beyond what is necessary. Luxurious purposelessness; bonus wonder.

        Of course, what is beautiful and marvelous are historically fickle measures. The vintage Moschino market—which tracks the general cultural value of kitsch—is enjoying a resurgence, but, Walker tells me, is skewed towards pieces in museum collections and worn by celebrities. Several Moschino items were part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “Notes on Camp” show in 2019, have been worn by celebrities, or become an occasion to celebrate Fran Drescher’s costumes on The Nanny, repopularized in part by the Instagram account @whatfranwore. This wave has missed the 2006 pasta pieces, which lack a curatorial or cultural champion. On the vintage market, they tend to be priced in the $200 to $300 range—not cheap, but not in the same tier as better-known items, which can exceed contemporary collections in price.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasta, more generally, has had a clout resurgence: see Sophie Colle’s pasta stool, Emily Ratajkowski posing with spaghetti, the anointing of just-OK downtown NYC Italian restaurant Forlini’s as an art and fashion party spot, Paul Smith’s pasta-filled anniversary capsule for SSENSE, et al.

          “THEY POSSESS THE SPECIFIC BLEND OF NAÏVETÉ AND WORLDLINESS THAT MAKES CAMP; IT MAKES ME WANT TO HOST A DINNER PARTY IN HEAD-TO-TOE PASTA GEAR.”

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to say whether the vicissitudes of the vintage market would have amused or rankled Franco Moschino, who frequently criticized the trend cycles of the fashion industry while participating in them, a dynamic he once compared to a “golden prison.” “Anything I do, even if I say 'Don’t buy my clothes,' they think it’s ironic, and they do it,” he once told Women’s Wear Daily. “But I really mean it. I mean stop the fashion system.” The intended message, according to Moschino, isn’t simply kitsch for kitsch’s sake; the hope is to both attract and arouse suspicion in the beholder. Like a poisonous frog’s brightly colored skin, it makes you look twice.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thread in postmodern Italian design, present in the Moschino oeuvre, is an attempt to reconcile the natural with the artificial, arranging the apparent opposites to show their continuity. The contention is that man-made stuff is as essential to our world as Earth’s older matter, and that it is, perhaps, a bigger lie to pretend that the human zeal for ingenuity, fakery, and gimmicks has no role in our aesthetic products. This acknowledgement can lead to affirmation—creating extravagantly tacky shit that makes the world seem brighter—or a more ambivalent note, a critique of the mechanisms of human artifice nested within an object produced by them, like an environmentally friendly vest with plastic pasta buttons, sold by a luxury retailer.

        Moschino has a history of remixing their older designs, tweaking their meaning by altering context. I asked Walker what she thought of the 2006 collection’s reinterpretation of the 1994 piece, which skips the earlier line’s environmentalist focus but keeps the pasta. She suggested that it’s a celebration of travel, summertime, “Italian heritage, things that are iconic”—timeless things, easy to love. That may be why the collection appeals to me right now. We need to fake it a little to feel those unburdened feelings. Besides, the most eco-friendly garments are ones that already exist, and the vintage pastawear fits the criteria.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best option I can find right now for acquiring a piece from the collection is a cream summer dress for sale on the resale site Carousell. Skeins of ribbon spaghetti twist over the shoulders, a handful of farfalle and rotini is scattered on the bodice, waist cinched with a thick red-and-white gingham ribbon. The seller is in Singapore, and Carousell limits buyers’ shipping addresses to a handful of nations within the Asia-Pacific, plus Canada. For an hour or two, I imagine ways of acquiring the dress—I borrow a Canadian friend’s phone number to create an account, which fails due to my American IP address. I wonder if it’s finally time to set up a VPN as I comb through reviews for package forwarding services.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours, I’m ready to put the idea gently to rest. It would be prohibitively expensive, and pinballing one dress between municipalities halfway across the world from each other represents a use of energy that, after the initial thrill of discovery wears off, feels difficult to justify. But for the moment there was that childlike rush of excitement at something from the realm of imagination manifesting in real life. I close the tab, and it remains in the fantasy realm, where it loses none of its vividness, like a cube of ice preserved in plastic, a fork-twirl of pasta captured in ribbon.
