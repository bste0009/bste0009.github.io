      1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50NdPawLVY"target="_blank">Figure out the source.</a><br>
      The best way to reduce irritability is to figure out what’s making you irritable—and then address it. Identify when you first became irritable and consider what might have set you off. It’s important to remember that while your reactions might feel complex at the moment, the issue that triggered them might be simple.<br>
      <br>
      2. Reduce caffeine and alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      3. It’s often the little things.<br>
      We often dismiss considering things that shouldn’t make us irritable even if they actually do. Be honest with yourself about what’s bothering you: Simply acknowledging that something is making you irritable is often enough to take the edge off. <br>
      <br>
      4. Get in touch with your compassion.<br>
      Being compassionate—with yourself—can be a powerful way to calm your churning emotions. <br>
      <br>
      5. Gain perspective.<br>
      We usually feel irritable about small-to-medium size annoyances—the kind we probably won’t remember in a few days or weeks. Take a few minutes to remind yourself of the larger picture—the things that are going well in your life and the things for which you can be grateful, such as health and employment. <br>
      <br>
      6. Rid yourself of nervous energy.<br>
      Since irritability activates our fight-or-flight response sets, it might be a good idea to take a quick walk or run, or, if that’s not possible, do some quick push-ups or crunches to rid yourself of excess energy that might be fueling your irritability. Fresh air on a leisurely walk could do wonders as well. For those who cannot use exercise, the entirely opposite approach works as well.<br>
      <br>
      7. Get quiet or alone time.<br>
      Find a quiet place to think things through, or to disengage from the commotion and activity around you. Irritability can be your mind’s way of alerting you that you need a break, so take one. Listen to music, do some stretching or yoga, meditate, or take a bubble bath. When you’re done, take a deep breath and prepare yourself to re-engage so your system isn’t shocked back into irritability once you re-enter the fray.
